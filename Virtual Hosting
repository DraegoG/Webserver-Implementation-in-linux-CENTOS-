Steps to implement web server:

1. First of all you have to install CENT OS in your computer.
2. Next, you have to install Apache server using command:
    # yum install httpd -y
    
3. Start the apache server using the command:
    # service httpd restart
4. After this command you will get a folder in /var/www/html . This "html" folder is the new created one.
5. Make a new directory inside "html", let say "website1" using command:
    # mkdir /var/www/html/website1 
6. Make an index file inside it using command:
    # echo "This is the website1" >> /var/www/html/website1/index.html

  ServerName www.website2.com     //This is the domain name of your 2nd website
  </VirtualHost>
